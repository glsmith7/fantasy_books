# Fantasy Book Generator

An implementation and expansion of the "Scroll and Codex" system from Autarch's [Axioms 14](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/406101/Axioms-Issue-14-Codex-and-Scroll) for [ACKS](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/99123/Adventurer-Conqueror-King-System) RPG system.

It produces an Excel file of fantasy books for use in libraries or treasure hoards.

I am a strictly amateur, self-taught programmer, and this was my first python code. Apologies for infelicities of style and algorithm.

## Features

* rapid generation of books--100 books can be generated in less than 30 seconds; 1000 can be done in under 5 minutes.
* Generate books by value (a fixed gp budget) or by number of volumes.
* A campaign-wide total number of books can be established. Thus, when new collections are generated, there is a chance (proportional to the number of books already discovered) to find another copy of the same book already generated.
* Random title generation;
* Random author name generation;
* Random translator (if application) name generation;
* Random subject generation;
* Random generation of "flavor title"--books in other languages are given "untranslated" titles as well. These use lorem ipsum text generators to create pseudo-Latin, Greek, Akkadian, Elvish, or Dwarvish titles;
* Generation tables in SQLite database;
* GUI interface via PySimpleGUI;
* Creation of Excel spreadsheets for ease of use;
* automatic archive of master list Excel files of generated books;
* quick access to campaign-wide stats on books (number of books created, number of unique volumes, total value of all books).
* each book automatically given a [UUID (universally unique Identifier)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier).

## Settings

From within the software, users can easily edit:
* languages not to be translated into (dead languages in the campaign can be translated, but newer works will not be translated into those dead languages)
* dice formula for additional years to be added to translation volume age
* chance of producing a translation
* chance of female authorship (default 50:50 for male:female) depending on historical milieu being simulated
* chance of a book being discovered that is incomplete
* chance that an author/translator will have a title (e.g., Doctor, Master, Magus, etc.)
* chance that an author/translator will have an epithet (e.g., the Fair, the Great, XIV, etc.)
* minimum age of book(s) generated
* maximum age of book(s) generated
* total number of books in campaign

## Other user-modifiable features

* Editing SQLite files allows additions or changes to:
** templates for book title generation
** first and last names
** language groups for name generation
** titles and epithets
** tables which generate the library

([Consider SQLiteStudio](https://sqlitestudio.pl/) for easy GUI editing of these files.)

# Editing *.txt files allows addition or change to lorem ipsum elements for foreign languages.

# Editing *.yaml files for settings allows other parameters to be customized.
